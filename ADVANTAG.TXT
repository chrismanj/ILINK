Advantages my program has over Thread:

1. Will not lock up if you press Escape at the Login
2. You can dial in no matter what screen the user is in. It will not allow
   garbage such as "CONNECT 9600" to be entered as if the user typed it in.
3. It will draw the remote screen for you the second you dial in.
4. When you exit the slave menu it will redraw the screen correctly.
5. When the remote screen is re-enabled the remote screen will be redrawn.
6. It only shows the title screen for 10 seconds or until a key is pressed.
7. When it shells out to run a program it resets the modem upon return.
8. It resets the modem after the slave port goes offline.
9. You can log in as root on newer SCO systems without it locking up.
10. It works correctly at all baud rates.
11. You can switch to page one correctly when dialed in.
12. You can get the remote computer to dial you back if the connection is lost
