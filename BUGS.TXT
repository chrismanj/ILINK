WHEN UPDATING FROM A TAPE THE FIRST LINE IS BEING DISPLAYED AT THE WRONG PLACE
  ON THE SCREEN

NEEDS TO FLUSH THE INPUT BUFFER AFTER HANGING UP.

IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE USER WHEN ONE DIALS INTO
  THE SLAVE PORT.

POTENTIAL TO LOCK UP WHEN SENDING FUNCTION KEYS BECAUSE INPUT IS NOT PROCESSED
  WHILE THE FUNCTION KEY TEXT IS BEING SENT. IF THE FUNCTION KEY HAS LOTS OF
  PAUSES IT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

DOES NOT RESET THE SCREEN COLORS CORRECTLY SOMETIMES WHEN SWITCHING FROM VT100
  BACK TO C332

DOES NOT SET CURSOR TO CORRECT SHAPE AFTER XMODEM UPLOAD
